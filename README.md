## About Me

I'm a girl who's passionate to learn programming (especially Python). My purpose for being here on GitHub is to learn, get advice, and connect with others ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I'm serious about the "get advice" part, so everyone's pretty much free to critique my projects (and not only projects), eg. what they like, what they dislike, should I make any changes, etc. Because, y'know, I'm a COMPLETE beginner in this field, and so I cannot fully trust myself in what I'm doing yet.

My main interests are:
- Programming: I thrive for skills in the Data Science field so, unsurprisingly, I'm focusing on Python first as my first step, then I'll probably learn more Excel, SQL, R, and similar stuff,
- Meteorology: Mostly extreme weather phenomena, and ESPECIALLY tornadoes. Fun fact: "TND" means "TorNaDo" and "531" stands for "May 31st" (which is the date of the El Reno Tornado 05-31-2013),
- Languages: I know Polish (because that's my native language), English (my second lanugage), basic Russian, really really basic Koine Greek, and I'm currently learning German (for the purpose of studying in Germany).

A Fan of:
- VOCALOID songs (really basic tho): I love listening their songs, especially songs like "Override", "Bug", "Mesmerizer", "Left Behind Generation" or "Self Proclaimed Angel". My fav character is Kasane Teto (because I like many of her songs, tho, honestly, I don't know much about the fandom.) üòÖ
- Alan Becker's Team's Animations: I adore their uniques style of animating, story-telling, and their dedication to their work.
